# (🦒 + 🐐) + 🖼 + 🕹 = **Llamarama**

A Llama based side scroller game built in `Canvas` where the objective is to survive as long as possible. Sounds easy? [Try it for yourself...](http://jamesformica.github.io/llamarama)

### Using
- 🖼 **Canvas**: for all the drawing
- ⚛️ **React**: for reasons
- ↔ **Redux**: for connecting the game's state
- ⏱ **Reavas**: for maintaining a 60fps paint loop
- 👨🏻‍🎨 **Watercolour**: for all the game's graphics (drawn by me and my fiancé)

### How to play
It's a pretty straightforward game, so here's how to play:
- Either click the screen or press the spacebar to jump. The longer you hold the click/spacebar the higher you jump
- You need to jump over the **voids** which randomly appear
- You need to jump over the **barrels** as they will push you off the screen if you don't
- There are also **bananas** which prevent the llama from jumping whilst ontop of one, so it is best to jump over those too
- The game will get faster and faster every 5 seconds and so will the difficulty

### Game Over
The game ends when the llama is no longer on the screen. Your score is based on how far you managed to travel.

> NOTE: there is no guarantee that every death will be avoidable. The obstacles are randomly generated which may result in a situation where you cannot survive. #sorrynotsorry

### Closing
This was such a fun game to create. Having to work out all the collision and scrolling was a good challenge. If you have any feedback please let me know! 😁
